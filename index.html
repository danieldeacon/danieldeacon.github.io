            <p>
                "Born in 1996 in Belville, Western Cape and raised on the banks of a river in Waterval Boven,
                Mpumalanga as the son of a convict or a farmer, depending on who you asked.
                I was expected to be the latter but discovered that leaving home at the age
                of 14 would lead me on another path...
                <br><br>
                From a broken home, to a musician, to writer, to a delinquent, to a leader in banking.
                I've seen it all, I've done it all."

                These skills have proven lucrative in sales, but my intentions are mostly consultative
                and can be applied in almost any role I assume."
